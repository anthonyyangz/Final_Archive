		    	<h2>WEB DESIGN | WINTER2019</h2>
		    	<p>First of all, the first thing that I felt throughout the whole course is efficiency on learning the language for website and computer. This course is useful for me since my major is Architecture and I need to learn a lot of things related to computer-based design. There is a lot in common that understanding how computer read specific languages even though web design is using different language with others. There is the same logic that a lot of languages are using the same as each other. </p>

          <p>Secondly, I appreciate all the things that we learn from the course, it really helps us to know what is web-design and we are able to actually make our own personal site after this class. The workload for this work is acceptable, and the schedule for each individual assignment and exercise is good for me, I could actually put a lot of thought while I was working on them. </p>

          <p>Lastly, I wish we can have more demos from the course, there are a lot of cool tricks that we can learn in order to understand the logic and function behind those codes. I found myself to learn actually quite a lot from the demos from online resources. However, if this class has a more advanced level in the future, I would love to take it again. </p>
