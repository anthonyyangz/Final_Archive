		    	<h2>What is code? Paul Ford</h2>
		    	<p>The reading gives me a basic understanding of how to code is created, especially how they work and evolve as time goes. I kept questioning about why there are so many types of languages for coding that we are using in the world even though the internet is seemed like a common thing in the world, the reading also explains in a way that the reason is the same as why we have many different languages from different countries.</p>

		    	<p>I agree with the fact that a lot of the things that we have now are designed for bringing more convenience to daily work. Different usability from different code giving people the ability to accomplish tasks easier. I was thinking if we are assigned to use one of the tools, are we gonna limited ourselves in the world which created by rules, so we would have the limitation and constrain ourselves. But the facts are not like that, the computer is too smart which results in they are able to follow every command that human give, and any specific details matter, if I am the person who is writing code and following the logic that people follow, the limitation would not constrain people and it would actually help people to perform better.</p>


	        <h2>What screens wants? Frank Chimero</h2>
		    	<p>For me, I felt the article is more likely writing about what audience wants. I think people tend to like more and more up-to-date feature, I would say I prefer the internet that we have nowaday much more than those from 10 years ago.</p>
        	<p>Human behavior and aesthetic are highly dominating what the web or internet should looks like, just like the motion-effect to make the changes which was mentioned in the article, if the audience prefer something, they are going to demand more for the things they like. The mainstream is forcing people to see or read whatever they have, and I found myself that I am accepting the mainstream even though I don’t really know what is right or wrong.

		    	<h2>Vernacular Web. Olia Lialina</h2>
		    	<p>The web design has been developed for a very long period of time, and it will be more developed in the future. Just like Olia Lialina stated in the article, “Step by step people were developing pages into a functioning web and it became less necessary to warn us, especially using road signs, about missing information.” The web design that we are learning today is based on the invention and improvement which were already done by the early experts, and we are taking advantages of making everything easier. I agreed the fact that if a website does not improve itself during a certain amount of time, the power or existence of it would easily be forgotten by the users, so a good website does require the maintenance and people would find something more interesting to go back over and over. I am the freshman for learning how to design a web page, and I also believe in the bias that would help us to change the way how we are going to present the page, the aesthetic and philosophical issues are highly dominated. The early web pages seemed like iconic for the icon or background styles that they were using, and they pretty much look very different from the things that we have now, I think the way how web makers did for their pages on the late 90s was forced to manage too much code because it was not yet well-developed and easy to adopt, the boundary and limitation limited the way how they can do. I think that is totally normal because I would also find myself hard to do something which I did not actually learn yet, everyone should have their own limitation.

          <h2>Jodi's Infrastructure. Alexander R. Galloway</h2>
		    	<p>From the Alexander R. Galloway, Jodi’s Infrastructure, it made me reconsider that my experience and my first-impression about web design. It was not actually like the poster which we can manage the layout and put everything as easy as drag and drop from the programs like Photoshop or Illustrator. The web pages were made because of the logic that people design in order for the computer to read it and function based on human behavior. In other ways, the language of code is just the same as a media from the people who used code to express their presentation. I agree that the trend that we are having is data-based and computer-based, the mathematicians from the computer make everything seem modernism, but it does not give us the constraints to stopping us to do anything, it offers the possibilities for creating something that unique from one to others.

		    	<h2>Vernacular Web. Samuel Earle</h2>
		    	<p>I totally agreed to the fact that we are the internet user who already lost our privacy when we started to use the internet. Even my grandma understands you permanent delete an email from your Google account does not mean you actually delete the email from the database itself, which means it might still exist actually and it is recoverable. “Knowledge may mean power, but information often means domination.” The loss of privacy would cause we to see something that might change our mind to make certain decision such us vote or buying stuff online, the internet would find out what I want to see, and what kind of stuff would change my mind, then they would give me more of that information in order to not “forced” me to change my mind. I kind of really hate that, just like if I ever check out something from my computer browser, I would see the advertisement of that when I use Instagram from my phone, it is very annoying. The world is being used as a wireless data system, the loss of privacy means our human right is actually being offended.

          <h2>Critical Atlas of Internet. Louise Drulhe</h2>
		    	<p>This article explains what the internet is in term of a large community which enables all the people in the world to all come to a common public space. The physical distance between a computer to a server is not relevant because you can basically access the data by one click with your computer. Because of the publicity of it, the daily activities of each of us should be easily recorded as the data and all the other people from the internet are actually being accessible. The big companies are having the smart engine like AI which can gather each of small individual data to organized like a huge database, so it would easy to calculate which are the things that people like the most. This article would confirm that the internet is double-sided, most of us can’t live without the internet, but we are actually sacrificing our privacy while we are using that.

		    	<h2>New Clues. Doc Searls and David Weinberger</h2>
		    	<p>“The glory of the Internet is that it lets us connect as diverse and distinct individuals, But we need to remember that delivering mass media is the least of the Net’s powers”. Before I have any in-depth research on knowledge about the internet, all the things that I knew were related to social media. The things that we see online are created by the people behind its content, they are hidden, and lots of time that they are also untraceable, which makes me curious about the same idea listed in the article, everything is double-sided, something that is created but they are not making sense, or they are even incorrect in terms of common sense.
          </p>

		    	<p>Personally, I felt the internet is also the dark side of human society, a lot of times that people are not responsible for what they say or what they do online, and clearly, there is not such a solution, there is also not a law for the whole internet society across among the whole world. The people that we see in person might be different with how he/she behave while using the internet, the point is, would the world be a better place if we did not even have the internet from the beginning, does the internet turn us to a bad person?
          </p>

          <p>The benefit from the gravity of sociality: The “network effect” is that thing where lots of people use something because lots of people use it. I think it’s fair to say that a lot of people are using internet for all kind of things, and most likely we can’t live without it.
          </p>

          <p>The article talks a lot about privacy, advertisement, and other stuff created by the big commercial internet companies. We are seeing a lot of the things which might cause us to lose privacy, and I am actually doubting the security of that privacy, does that against to human right if my privacy becomes a part of the huge database?
